[-] Take .jpg where A is nearly 0.8MPa.
[-] gauge A's angle verification
[-] threshold search for cv2.threshold
[-] show_img_bin() for debug.
[ ] threshold for bin/Hough need to be optimized.
    sometimes fails to identify the arrow.
[ ] Recognition of night vision fails.

       A : detects the lower edge of the pressure gauge ring.
       B : detects the texts on the pressure gauge label.
    - mask ?
    - detect night/day vision and use different parameters?
